### **Introduction**
AI and Machine Learning have always fascinated me—the idea of building intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and innovate is just mind-blowing! But let’s be real—starting this journey wasn’t easy. I tried multiple times, only to be pulled away by academics, competitive exams, and the ever-present chaos of life.

But not anymore. I’ve finally set my priorities straight and designed a **structured, no-nonsense roadmap** to mastering AI and Deep Learning. This blog is all about how I curated my **resources, planned my schedule**, and set up a sustainable learning routine. If you’re struggling with where to start, this might help you too!


### **Curating the Perfect Resources** 📚
I wanted to strike the right balance between **theory, mathematics, and practical implementation**. Here’s the ultimate stack I’m using:

#### **1️⃣ Mathematics for ML**  
> *Book: "Mathematics for Machine Learning"*

Before diving deep into ML, I knew I needed a solid math foundation—especially **Linear Algebra, Probability, and Calculus**. This book breaks down the exact math concepts ML engineers use daily.

#### **2️⃣ Deep Learning (MIT Press)**  
> *Book: "Deep Learning" (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series, MIT Press)*

This is my go-to **theoretical deep dive** into ML and AI. It’s packed with fundamentals on **Neural Networks, Optimization, and Generative Models**.

#### **3️⃣ Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras (O'Reilly)**  
> *Practical coding guide for ML & DL*

I needed a hands-on resource that would help me **write actual models, not just read about them**. This book is perfect for coding along and understanding real-world implementation.

#### **4️⃣ Python Data Science Handbook (O'Reilly)**  
> *Data wrangling, Pandas, NumPy, and visualization*

ML is all about **data**. This book ensures I can handle, preprocess, and visualize datasets efficiently before building models.

#### **5️⃣ Krish Naik’s ML & DL Bootcamp (Video Course)**  
> *Comprehensive ML & DL video course*

I needed something structured for **guidance and coding demos**—this course complements my reading material and helps me stay on track.


### **My Study Plan: Balancing Math & ML** ⏳
Time management was one of my biggest challenges. I designed a schedule that helps me **deep dive into math without losing ML momentum**:

#### **📅 Weekly Study Plan:**
✅ **Tuesday & Wednesday → Deep Math Focus** (Only Math for ML)  
✅ **Thursday → Chill/Review Day** (Light revision + fun projects)  
✅ **Friday to Monday → ML-Heavy Days** (Theory, coding, hands-on projects)  

#### **🔥 How I Break Down My Study Sessions:**
- **Mornings:** Theory from books 📖
- **Afternoons:** Coding & implementation 💻
- **Evenings:** Notes, revision & small projects 🧠


### **How This Plan is Working for Me** 💡
- **No more distractions**: My priorities are clear—Math & ML. DSA can wait. 🚀  
- **Balanced learning**: I get both the theoretical depth and practical coding experience.  
- **Sustainable progress**: The structured plan prevents burnout and keeps me consistent.  

I’m finally making **real progress in ML and Deep Learning** after years of trying! If you’re in the same boat, I hope this blog helps you find your roadmap too.
