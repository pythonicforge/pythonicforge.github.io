That quote hit different when I realized I had no real idea how well I knew the languages I used every day. So I built **Skillz** — a fun, terminal-based app to track and visualize my programming skill levels.

<br/>

### What is Skillz?

Skillz is a **CLI (Command Line Interface)** tool built with Python that lets you:
- Add and update programming languages you’re learning
- Track your skill level (0-100)
- View a cool dashboard with progress bars
- Store your data in a local SQLite database
- And (soon) get rated by AI based on your knowledge 👀

<br/>

### 💡 Why I Built This

I’m deep into learning **FastAPI** and want to understand both backend dev and Python at a deeper level. But while I was grinding, I realized I had no clear **snapshot** of where I stand with the languages I use.

Also, I’ve never worked with databases before — so this became the perfect excuse to dive into **SQLite** and integrate it with a Python project.

<br/>

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python 3.10+**
- 🎨 **termcolor** (for colorful terminal output)
- 🗃️ **SQLite3** (for persistent skill storage)
- 🧠 Coming soon: **AI-powered assessments** using LLMs

<br/>

### 🛠️ Features

| Feature | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Add/Update Skills | ✅ | Add a language and assign a skill level (0-100) |
| Dashboard View | ✅ | See all your skills and progress bars |
| Delete Skill | ✅ | Remove a language you no longer use |
| Color-coded Logs | ✅ | Warnings, Errors, and Info in pretty colors |
| SQLite DB | ✅ | Skills persist between sessions |
| AI Skill Evaluator | 🔜 | Let AI quiz and rate you |
| GitHub Integration | 🧠 Idea | Analyze public repos to infer skill level |

<br/>

### 🖼️ Dashboard Sneak Peek

```bash
(sh) show
DASHBOARD

Python     [███████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 65%
JavaScript [█████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 40%
Rust       [██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 10%
```

Progress bars are generated with logic that maps the skill level to the bar length — simple, clean, and satisfying 😌

<br/>

### 🧠 What I Learned

- **How the `cmd` module works** to build REPL-like CLIs
- Working with **SQLite in Python** — connections, cursors, error handling
- Using `termcolor` for clean UX in terminals
- A better understanding of **project structure and extensibility**

<br/>

### 🚀 The Road Ahead

This is just the beginning. Here’s what’s planned:

- ✨ **AI-based evaluation** (LLMs asking questions & rating answers)
- 📊 Export dashboard to markdown or image
- 🌐 Integrate with GitHub to auto-score based on contributions
- 🧑‍💻 API version (Skillz as a backend service?)
- 🎓 Shareable dev profiles for bragging rights 😏

<br/>

### 💬 Final Thoughts

Skillz isn’t just a tracker — it’s a way of gamifying your dev journey. Every time I update a skill, I get a little dopamine hit and a sense of progress.

It’s like Duolingo for devs, but in your terminal.

If you vibe with the idea, feel free to fork it, improve it, or just use it for yourself. The grind is real — but tracking your growth makes it way more satisfying. 🚀
