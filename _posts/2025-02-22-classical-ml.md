Hey everyone! Today, I dived into the basics of **classification** in Machine Learning as part of my daily learning streak. It was a pretty interesting session, and I wanted to share what I learned.

### What is Classification?
Classification is a type of machine learning task where the goal is to categorize data into predefined labels or classes. It works by training a model on labeled data so that it can predict the correct category for new, unseen data. Some cool examples include:

- **Spam Detection**: Classifying emails as "spam" or "not spam."
- **Image Recognition**: Distinguishing between objects like cats and dogs.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Predicting whether a patient has a disease based on their symptoms and medical history.

### Supervised Learning & Classification
Classification falls under **supervised learning**, meaning that the model learns from labeled data where each input has a corresponding correct output. The process involves:
1. **Training**: Feeding the model with historical data that includes features (input variables) and labels (correct categories).
2. **Testing**: Evaluating the model's performance on new, unseen data.

#### Types of Classification
Today, I also learned that classification problems can be of two types:

1. **Binary Classification**: When there are only two possible classes.
   - Example: "Yes" or "No" for loan approvals.

2. **Multiclass Classification**: When there are more than two possible classes.
   - Example: Classifying handwritten digits (0-9) in the MNIST dataset.

### Unsupervised Learning: How It Differs
While classification is part of supervised learning, **unsupervised learning** is different because it deals with unlabeled data. Instead of predicting a category, unsupervised learning groups data into clusters based on patterns and similarities. A common example is **clustering**, like grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.

### Common Algorithms for Classification
Some popular classification algorithms I came across today include:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**
- **Neural Networks**

Each of these algorithms has its strengths and is used depending on the problem's complexity and data characteristics.

### Wrapping Up
Iâ€™m really enjoying this daily learning habit, and todayâ€™s topic on classification was a great one! Itâ€™s amazing to see how ML models can classify data and make predictions based on past patterns. Canâ€™t wait to explore more tomorrow!

Stay tuned for the next update! ðŸš€
